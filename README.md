### 42 Core Program Repository

This repository contains my journey through the 42 Core Program, including solutions, notes, and projects developed during the curriculum. The 42 Core Program is a rigorous, project-based learning experience focused on cultivating strong problem-solving skills, low-level programming knowledge, and a deep understanding of computer science fundamentals.
